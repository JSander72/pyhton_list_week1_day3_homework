# Python List Transformation

Objective: The aim of this assignment is to practice advanced list operations and transformations.

Problem Statement: You've been given a list of numerical grades from a class exam. You need to process and analyze these grades.

Task 1: Given the list of grades:

grades = [85, 90, 78, 88, 76, 95, 89, 80, 72, 93]
Sort the grades in descending order and display the sorted list.

Task 2: Calculate the average grade from the list above and display it (reminder: The average is calculated by dividing the sum of all grades by the length of the grades list).

2.Advanced Slicing Techniques
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to master the art of slicing in Python lists.

Problem Statement: You have a list of daily temperatures for a month, and you'd like to extract specific data from it.

Task 1: Given the list of temperatures:

temperatures = [72, 75, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106]
Extract the temperatures for the second week (7 days) of the month. Expected Outcome:

83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90,

Task 2: Extract all the temperatures above 100 (reminder: when slicing to the end of a list you don't need a stop index).

Task 3: extract temperatures from the 5th to the 10
